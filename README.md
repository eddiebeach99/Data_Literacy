# Data Literacy - The Evolution of Design Complexity in LEGO Sets

This our code to our Data Literacy project about the design complexity of LEGO sets. For this we used the Rebrickable (https://rebrickable.com/downloads/) database about LEGO sets between 1949 and 2024.

## How to use
First of all run the data_preperation.ipynb file to get the data (only needed to run exploratory_analysis.ipynb). 
The different analysis files can be run independently from each other.

## Different analyses
* An exploratory analysis of the LEGO dataset is implemented in the exploratory_analysis.ipynb
* A linear and an exponential regression of the complexity of LEGO sets is implemented in complexity_regression.ipynb
* A clustering and further analysis of the clusters of the complexity of LEGO sets is implemented in clustering.ipynb

## Required packages
* math
* matplotlib
* numpy 
* pandas
* scipy
* seaborn
* sklearn
