# Data Literacy - The Evolution of Design Complexity in LEGO Sets

This repository cointains the code to our Data Literacy project about the design complexity of LEGO sets. 
Therefore we used the Rebrickable (https://rebrickable.com/downloads/) database with information on LEGO sets 
between 1949 and 2024.

## How to use
First run the data_preperation.ipynb file to receive the data (only needed to run exploratory_analysis.ipynb). 
The different analysis files can be run independently from each other.

## Different analyses
* An exploratory analysis of the LEGO dataset is implemented in the exploratory_analysis.ipynb
* A linear and an exponential regression of the complexity of LEGO sets is implemented in complexity_regression.ipynb
* A clustering and further analysis of the clusters of the complexity of LEGO sets is implemented in clustering.ipynb

## Required packages
* math
* matplotlib
* numpy 
* pandas
* scipy
* seaborn
* sklearn
