# Data_Literacy

Code to our Data Literacy project about the complexity of Lego sets.

## How to use
First of all run the data_preperation.ipynb file to get the data. Afterwards the different analysis files can be run.

## Different analysis
* An exploratory analysis of the Lego dataset is implemented in the exploratory_analysis.ipynb
* A linear and an exponential Regression of the complexity of Lego sets is implemented in complexity_regression.ipynb
* A clustering and further analysis of the clusters of the complexity of Lego sets is implemented in clustering.ipynb
