# Data Literacy

This our code to our Data Literacy project about the complexity of Lego sets. For this we used the Rebrickable (https://rebrickable.com/downloads/) dataset about Lego sets between 1949 and 2024.

## How to use
First of all run the data_preperation.ipynb file to get the data (only needed to run exploratory_analysis.ipynb). 
The different analysis files can be run independently from each other.

## Different analyses
* An exploratory analysis of the Lego dataset is implemented in the exploratory_analysis.ipynb
* A linear and an exponential Regression of the complexity of Lego sets is implemented in complexity_regression.ipynb
* A clustering and further analysis of the clusters of the complexity of Lego sets is implemented in clustering.ipynb
